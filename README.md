Hello World
===========

This 'Hello World' program shows how to use go-v8 to compile and run JavaScript code then get the result.

```go
package main

import "github.com/idada/go-v8"

func main() {
	engine := v8.NewEngine()
	script := engine.Compile([]byte("'Hello ' + 'World!'"), nil, nil)
	context := engine.NewContext(nil)

	context.Scope(func(cs v8.ContextScope) {
		result := script.Run()
		println(result.ToString())
	})
}
```

Performance and Stability 
=========================

The benchmark result on my iMac:

```
NewContext     249474 ns/op
NewInteger        984 ns/op
NewString         983 ns/op
NewObject        1036 ns/op
NewArray0        1130 ns/op
NewArray5        1314 ns/op
NewArray20       1666 ns/op
NewArray100      3124 ns/op
Compile         11059 ns/op
PreCompile      11697 ns/op
RunScript        1085 ns/op
JsFunction       1114 ns/op
GoFunction       1630 ns/op
Getter           2060 ns/op
Setter           2934 ns/op
TryCatch        43097 ns/op
```

I write many test and benchmark to make sure go-v8 stable and efficient.

There is a shell script named 'test.sh' in the project. 

It can auto configure cgo environment variables and run test.

For example:

```
./test.sh . .
```

The above command will run all of test and benchmark.

The first argument of test.sh is test name pattern, second argument is benchmark name pattern.

For example:

```
./test.sh ThreadSafe Array
```

The above command will run all of thread safe test and all of benchmark about Array type.

Concepts
========

Engine
------

In go-v8, engine type is the wrapper of v8::Isolate.

Because V8 engine use thread-local storage but cgo calls may be execute in different thread. So go-v8 use v8::Locker to make sure V8 engine's thread-local data initialized. And the locker make go-v8 thread safe.

You can create different engine instance for data isolate or improve efficiency of concurrent purpose.

```go
engine1 := v8.NewEngine()
engine2 := v8.NewEngine()
```

Script
------

When you want to run some JavaScript. You need to compile first.

Scripts can run many times or run in different context.

```go
script := engine.Compile([]byte(`"Hello " + "World!"`), nil, nil)
```

The Engine.Compile() method take 3 arguments. 

The first is the code.

The second is a ScriptOrigin, it stores script's file name or line number offset etc. You can use ScriptOrigin to make error message and stack trace friendly.

```go
name := "my_file.js"
real := ReadFile(name)
code := "function(_export){\n" + real + "\n}"
origin := engine.NewScriptOrigin(name, 1, 0)
script := engine.Compile(code, origin, nil)
```

The third is a ScriptData, it's pre-parsing data, as obtained by Engine.PreCompile(). If you want to compile a script many time, you can use ScriptData to speeds compilation. 

```go
code := []byte(`"Hello " + "World!"`)
data := engine.PreCompile(code)
script1 := engine.Compile(code, nil, data)
script2 := engine.Compile(code, nil, data)
```

Context
-------

The description in V8 embedding guide:

> In V8, a context is an execution environment that allows separate, unrelated, JavaScript applications to run in a single instance of V8. You must explicitly specify the context in which you want any JavaScript code to be run.

In go-v8, you can create many contexts from a V8 engine instance. When you want to run some JavaScript in a context. You need to enter the context by calling Scope() and run the JavaScript in the callback.

```go
context.Scope(func(cs v8.ContextScope){
	script.Run()
})
```

Context in V8 is necessary. So in go-v8 you can do this:

```go
context.Scope(func(cs v8.ContextScope) {
	context2 := engine.NewContext(nil)
	context2.Scope(func(cs2 v8.ContextScope) {

	})
})
```

Please note. Don't take any JavaScript value out scope.

When the outermost Scope() return, all of the JavaScript value created in this scope or nested scope will be destroyed.
